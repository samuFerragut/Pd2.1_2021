## WHAT TO DO?
You'll have to create a website example using the technology and a Google Docs Presentation and optionally, deploy the website.

### 2. Google Docs Presentation
* Create a video presentation of 5 to 10 minutes

* Every member of a team will record a part of the video separately using a video recording software

* Using a video edition software, append the videos into one file and embed it in the about section of the webpage

* In the presentation, you're going to defend your technology against the others.

* You should talk about:

*  Installation
*  Available documentation / community
*  Main features: Responsiveness, Grid System, theming, integration with other tools/frameworks ....
*  Performance
*  Integration with front frameworks (vue.js, react.js, angular.js, etc)
